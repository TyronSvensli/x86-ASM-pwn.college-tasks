In a previous level you computed the average of 4 integer quad words, which
was a fixed amount of things to compute, but how do you work with sizes you get when
the program is running?

In most programming languages a structure exists called the
for-loop, which allows you to do a set of instructions for a bounded amount of times.
The bounded amount can be either known before or during the programs run, during meaning
the value is given to you dynamically.

As an example, a for-loop can be used to compute the sum of the numbers 1 to n:
  sum = 0
  i = 1
  while i <= n:
    sum += i
    i += 1

Please compute the average of n consecutive quad words, where:
  rdi = memory address of the 1st quad word
  rsi = n (amount to loop for)
  rax = average computed

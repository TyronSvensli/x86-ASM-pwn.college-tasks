In previous levels you discovered the for-loop to iterate for a *number* of times, both dynamically and
statically known, but what happens when you want to iterate until you meet a condition?

A second loop structure exists called the while-loop to fill this demand.

In the while-loop you iterate until a condition is met.

As an example, say we had a location in memory with adjacent numbers and we wanted
to get the average of all the numbers until we find one bigger or equal to 0xff:
  average = 0
  i = 0
  while x[i] < 0xff:
    average += x[i]
    i += 1
  average /= i

Using the above knowledge, please perform the following:
  Count the consecutive non-zero bytes in a contiguous region of memory, where:
    rdi = memory address of the 1st byte
    rax = number of consecutive non-zero bytes

Additionally, if rdi = 0, then set rax = 0 (we will check)!
